Recommender systems are systems that help users discover items they may like. They help users discover new books, movies, and products, and help companies by promoting relevant products to prospective customers.

### Why Goodreads?
The Goodreads book dataset is a collection of data about books and ratings from the Goodreads website. It can be used to build recommendation systems or to analyze trends and patterns in book ratings and reviews. The Goodreads book dataset includes information about the books themselves, such as the title, author, publisher, and genre, as well as ratings and reviews from users. It also includes information about the users themselves, such as their location and the books they have rated and reviewed.

### Approach

In our project we used two different approaches: Popularityâ€“based Recommendation as well as Collaborative filtering approach to analyze and make suitable recommendations.
A population-based recommendation system is a type of recommendation system that makes recommendations based on the overall preferences of a large group of users, rather than the individual preferences of a single user. This approach is often used in situations where there is a large dataset of user ratings or preferences, and the goal is to identify items that are popular or well-liked by a broad audience. In our project, we use a population-based recommendation system based on metrics like ratings and review count.
Collaborative filtering is a technique used to make recommendations based on the preferences of a group of users. It works by analyzing the past behavior of a group of users and identifying items that are highly rated by similar users.
There are two main types of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based. In user-based collaborative filtering, recommendations are made based on the preferences of similar users. For example, if Alice and Bob both rated a particular movie highly, and Alice also rated a second movie highly, the system might recommend the second movie to Bob.
In item-based collaborative filtering, recommendations are made based on the similarity between items. For example, if Alice and Bob both rated a particular movie highly, and the movie is similar to a second movie that Alice also rated highly, the system might recommend the second movie to Bob.
